## This Project Documentation is submitted in partial fulfillment for the requirement for the Degree in Computer Science Academic Year 2020-2021/1441 (Semester-II)
 
## MOTIVATION
As we know that watching movies is part of human life and that technology has become necessary in all things, we decided to develop a system that allows the user to know the appropriate classification of films by analyzing images. And to enable the user to the quick search process and ease of access. 

## PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Many people are attracted to a poster, but when he finishes watching the movie, he puts a bad rating because he does not have enough information about the type of film or the appropriate age. This is very important information before choosing a movie in the movie theater or when purchasing a movie.
## PROJECT OBJECTIVES
- Design a method that simulates artificial intelligence to reveal movie information.
-	Add a new search method for movies.
-	Motivate people with technology and artificial intelligence to help them facilitate standard research methods into smart methods.
## PROJECT SCOPE
The scope will be in moviesâ€™ world. When the project is completed, it will be able to provide an accurate, modern, and easy way to search for films.
